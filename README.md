# Machine Learning: Feature Selection and Classification #

## Project Goals ##

To carry out an analysis of the feature selection and classification tools within pythonâ€™s sklearn. By utilizing these methods, the goal is determine the most important features and best classification method for predicting which patients are CHF patients vs. non-CHF patients based on the existing dataset. 


### Feature Selection Tools Used ###

1. KBest
2. RFE
3. Chi2

These will be used to select out the features that will be most useful for classifying the CHF from non-CHF patients.

### Classification Tools Used ###

The selected features from above were then fed into the following classifiers to determine which classifier was the most efficient for classifying CHF patients.

1. Gaussian Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. SVC 
4. Random Forest

### Results ###

An analysis of the results for the CHF dataset is included within this repository discussing how each of these methods performed on the classification of CHF vs. non-CHF patients.
